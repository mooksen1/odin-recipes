    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a <em>delicious</em>, comforting and creamy one pot chicken pot pie recipe and i'm gonna show you how to make it. side note: I would strongly recommend using a cast iron skillet or any kind of pan that can go into the oven. </p>
    <p>I am also going to add that this recipe <em>only puts a pie crust on top</em>, instead on enclosed in a shell like most chicken pot pie recipes. I find it less doughy and it is my personal preference, but feel free to use a pie shell instead and make it more traditionally. The filling is the most important part!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup frozen mixed veggies</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 stick butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onions</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 pie crust</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Add flour, chicken broth, frozen veggies and chicken into the pot.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream, and all our seasonings mentioned earlier, mix well and that's the filling done!</li>
        <li>If you didn't make the filling in a cast iron skillet already, move it now into a skillet, or any oven safe pan.</li>
        <li>Now unroll the pie crust and put it on top of your filling. Crimp the sides with a fork. Make sure to poke a few holes in the top!</li>
        <li>Scramble an egg in a bowl and brush on your egg wash onto your pie crust. </li>
        <li>Put your pie in the oven at 400, and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
